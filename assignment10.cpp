* Program:
*    Assignment 10, Hello World 
*    Brother Schwieder, CS124
* Author:
*    Will Brown
* Summary: 
*
*    This program is to display the words "Hello World" to the user.
*    This is the first program of hopefully many to help me in my 
*    understanding of programming.
*
*    Estimated:  1.0 hrs   
*    Actual:     2.0 hrs
*      The most difficult part was just getting use to the operating system
*      and the format and layout. I had no idea there were things such as
*      styleChecker and testBed but so glad they exist.
